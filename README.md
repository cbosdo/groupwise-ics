groupwise-ics
=============

groupwise-ics aims at providing a way to synchronize GroupWise calendars with
local iCalendar file.

This code has been produced during [SUSE Hackweek 10][0] and is still in a hightly
experimental state. The groupwise to ics part of the synchronization is
working, though not optimized, but the other way round still needs some love to
actually push anything to GroupWise.
